        <h2>History of Cheese Making</h2> <!--Cheese History start--> <!--all p's-->
        <p>
            Cheese making dates back thousands of years, likely originating around 8000 to 7000 BCE, shortly after
            humans first began domesticating animals like sheep and goats. It's believed that cheese was discovered by
            accident—milk stored in animal stomachs would have curdled naturally due to the presence of rennet, an
            enzyme found in the stomach lining, creating early forms of cheese. This process provided a way to preserve
            milk in a more stable and portable form.
        </p>

        <p>
            By 3000 BCE, ancient civilizations such as the Mesopotamians, Egyptians, and Greeks were already producing
            cheese. Their versions were typically salty and acidic, used primarily for nourishment and long-term storage
            rather than gourmet enjoyment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The craft of cheese making saw significant refinement during the Roman Empire. The Romans not only improved
            techniques for curdling, pressing, and aging cheese but also spread these practices throughout Europe as
            their empire expanded. This helped establish regional styles and traditions that would evolve over
            centuries.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the Middle Ages, cheese making became an important monastic tradition. Monks in European monasteries
            played a major role in developing and perfecting many of the aged cheeses we still know today, such as
            Roquefort in France, Parmesan in Italy, and various soft-ripened varieties like Brie.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Renaissance and the early modern period saw cheese becoming more widespread and diverse across Europe.
            By the 19th century, the rise of microbiology and food science led to better understanding of fermentation
            and hygiene. This, along with pasteurization, allowed cheese to be produced more consistently and safely.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 20th century, cheese making underwent industrialization, particularly in places like the United
            States, where mass production techniques allowed for large-scale distribution. Despite this shift,
            traditional cheese making still thrives today, with artisan producers continuing to preserve centuries-old
            methods. Today, cheese is enjoyed in countless varieties around the world, blending ancient techniques with
            modern innovation.

        <h2>How Cheese is Made</h2> <!--Cheese Making start--> <!--organized list with unorganized list in it-->
        <p>Cheese is made through a process that involves coagulating milk, separating the solids (<em>curds</em>) from
            the
            liquid (<em>whey</em>), and then aging or processing the curds. Here's a simplified breakdown of the main
            steps:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Milk Selection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheese starts with <strong>milk</strong> — usually from cows, goats, or sheep.</li>
                    <li>The milk is typically <strong>pasteurized</strong> to kill harmful bacteria, although some
                        cheeses use raw milk.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Acidification</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>starter culture</strong> (<em>good bacteria</em>) is added to the milk.</li>
                    <li>These bacteria convert <strong>lactose</strong> (<em>milk sugar</em>) into <strong>lactic
                            acid</strong>,
                        developing flavor and acidity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Coagulation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rennet</strong>, an enzyme, is added to curdle the milk.</li>
                    <li>The milk separates into <strong>curds</strong> (<em>solids</em>) and <strong>whey</strong>
                        (<em>liquids</em>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Cutting the Curds</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The curds are cut into smaller pieces to release more whey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smaller curds</strong> result in <strong>drier cheese</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Cooking & Stirring</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The curds may be gently heated and stirred.</li>
                    <li>This helps remove more whey and firms up the curds.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Draining & Salting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The whey is drained off from the curds.</li>
                    <li>Curds are salted by either mixing in salt or soaking in a <strong>brine solution</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Shaping & Pressing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Curds are placed into molds and often <strong>pressed</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This gives the cheese its shape and removes excess whey.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Aging (Affinage)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some cheeses are aged from weeks to years in controlled environments.</li>
                    <li>During aging, flavors develop and textures change.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Variations in milk type, bacteria used, aging time, moisture, add-ons, etc. all contribute to the huge
            variety of cheeses around the world. </p>

        <h2>Kinds of Cheese</h2> <!--Cheese Kinds start--> <!--definition list-->

        <p>There are many different kinds of cheese, each with their own flavors, origins, and quirks. Here's a list of
            cheese among our selection:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Havarti</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> Denmark<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Havarti was created in the 19th century by a Danish woman named Hanne
                Nielsen, who was passionate about modernizing cheese making. It's one of the few cheeses that can be
                aged or eaten young — aging it gives it a nutty flavor!
            </dd>

            <dt>Muenster</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> United States (inspired by French Munster cheese)<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> American Muenster is known for its orange rind, which comes from
                <em>annatto</em>, a natural food coloring made from seeds. Despite its bold color, Muenster is
                incredibly mild and melts beautifully, making it a grilled cheese superstar.
            </dd>

            <dt>Brie</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> France<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Often called the "Queen of Cheeses," Brie was reportedly served at the
                Congress of Vienna in 1815, where it won over diplomats and royalty alike. Its white, edible rind is
                made of mold — don't worry, it's completely safe and delicious!
            </dd>

            <dt>Parmesan (Parmigiano-Reggiano)</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> Italy<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> True Parmigiano-Reggiano must be aged at least <strong>12 months</strong> —
                some wheels are aged over <strong>36 months</strong>! It's so valued in Italy that wheels of it have
                even been used as <em>bank collateral</em>.
            </dd>

            <dt>Roquefort</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> France<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Roquefort is made with sheep's milk and aged in natural limestone caves in
                the village of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. Legend has it the mold was discovered when a young shepherd left
                his lunch in a cave and returned later to find blue-veined cheese.
            </dd>

            <dt>Cheddar</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> England<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The term “Cheddaring” refers to the special process of stacking and turning
                curds to drain whey — unique to this cheese. The world's largest Cheddar ever made weighed <strong>over
                    56,000 pounds</strong>!
            </dd>

            <dt>Gouda</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> Netherlands<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Gouda accounts for over <strong>50% of Dutch cheese production</strong>.
                Older (aged) Gouda becomes caramel-colored, hard, and develops crunchy crystals called
                <em>tyrosine</em>, which are actually amino acid clusters — and cheese nerds love them.
            </dd>

            <dt>Mozzarella</dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> Italy<br>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Traditional mozzarella is made from <strong>water buffalo milk</strong>
                (mozzarella di bufala). It's one of the few cheeses that's <strong>stretched</strong> — a process called
                <em>pasta filata</em> — giving it that signature stringy texture when melted.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>We hope you find a cheese that fits for you! We'll add more kinds of cheese to our shop as we go along.</p>
